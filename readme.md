# MyFit: Real-Time Automated Assistance for Personalized Fitness and Nutrition

## Overview:

In the evolving landscape of fitness, virtual fitness assistance has gained popularity as a guiding force for individuals on their health and wellness journeys. However, these conventional virtual fitness assistants lack personalization and real-time progress tracking, hampering effectiveness and interactivity. Going beyond conventional approaches, our platform provides users with tailored exercise routines and nutritional guidance, considering their unique fitness history, current levels, and health objectives ensuring that workout plans are aligned with each user's capabilities, creating a more effective and engaging fitness journey. Further, our system leverages Mediapipe for real-time posture monitoring during workouts allowing proper guidance and posture correction thereby minimizing the risk of injury due to poor posture during exercise. Furthermore, our system dynamically adjusts exercise and diet recommendations based on user performance and nutrient consumption. This personalized approach ensures evolving guidance that reflects user progress and adapts to changing fitness needs. Integrated robust progress tracking tools contribute to user motivation, offering transparent insights into metrics like weight, fitness level, and exercise performance. By offering personalized guidance, real-time feedback, and robust progress tracking, our platform becomes an integral part of users' holistic well-being journeys, facilitating continuous steps toward their health and fitness goals.
